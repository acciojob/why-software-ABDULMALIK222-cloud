	<h1>"Why i want to become a developer?"</h1>
	<p>"My motivation to become a software developer stems from a deep curiosity about how technology shapes the world around us. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the problem-solving nature of programming, where every challenge offers an opportunity to innovate and create solutions. The ability to bring ideas to life through code, making a tangible impact on how people interact with technology, is incredibly fulfilling. Additionally, the ever-evolving nature of the tech industry offers endless learning opportunities, which is something I find both exciting and inspiring. Becoming a developer gives me the chance to continually grow, solve complex problems, and contribute to building a better future."</p>
